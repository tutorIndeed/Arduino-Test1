With every Course introduce AI as a supp teaching/learnig tool.
Tell how fast the misunderstanding is removed, thats how fast you will learn and conquer
new subjects. So intriduce any one AI and show how drill down to clear undrestanding
by arguing with Ai to clarify to as low as possible nitty gritty details, something you
cannot do with a real teacher, so real teachers may not be the best teachers simetimes or 
in some circumstances like an AI app (chatGPT, copilot, gemini, etc). Do not have to offer 
a course, just thru real interaction students will learn to use it
